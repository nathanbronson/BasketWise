class ReduceLROnPlateau(Callback):
    """Reduce learning rate when a metric has stopped improving.
    Models often benefit from reducing the learning rate by a factor
    of 2-10 once learning stagnates. This callback monitors a
    quantity and if no improvement is seen for a 'patience' number
    of epochs, the learning rate is reduced.
    Example:
    ```python
    reduce_lr = ReduceLROnPlateau(monitor='val_loss', factor=0.2,
                                  patience=5, min_lr=0.001)
    model.fit(X_train, Y_train, callbacks=[reduce_lr])
    ```
    Args:
        monitor: quantity to be monitored.
        factor: factor by which the learning rate will be reduced.
          `new_lr = lr * factor`.
        patience: number of epochs with no improvement after which learning rate
          will be reduced.
        verbose: int. 0: quiet, 1: update messages.
        mode: one of `{'auto', 'min', 'max'}`. In `'min'` mode,
          the learning rate will be reduced when the
          quantity monitored has stopped decreasing; in `'max'` mode it will be
          reduced when the quantity monitored has stopped increasing; in
          `'auto'` mode, the direction is automatically inferred from the name
          of the monitored quantity.
        min_delta: threshold for measuring the new optimum, to only focus on
          significant changes.
        cooldown: number of epochs to wait before resuming normal operation
          after lr has been reduced.
        min_lr: lower bound on the learning rate.
